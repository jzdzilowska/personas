It also helps identify whether confusion or frustration starts early and persists over time. The interviews revealed several consistent pain points - many users’ first experiences were marked by frustration, especially due to the unreliable card reader, which often required multiple swipes before recognizing Brown ID.

The interviews showed that time efficiency is pivotal - most students mentioned using the kiosk in-between classes, rushing during short breaks.
